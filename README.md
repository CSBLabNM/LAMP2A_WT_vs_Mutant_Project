# LAMP2A_WT_vs_Mutant_Project
# **Membrane Burial of Juxtamembrane Residues Weakens Oligomeric Interactions Leading to LAMP2A Inactivation**

This repository contains simulation files for both monomeric and homotrimeric assemblies of human LAMP-2A, including the wild-type (WT) and its inactive mutant, within a biologically relevant lysosomal membrane environment. The 1000ns simulations were performed using GROMACS.

# **Repository Contents**

- **PDB Files:** Protein Data Bank files that contain the 3D structures of proteins and lipids used in the simulations.
- **LAMP2A_WT_monomer_initial_1ns_centered** (`.pdb` files extracted from AF3 containg the residues of HSC70 lid domain with CMA substrate segments of KFERQ-type motif)





- **XTC Files:** Compressed trajectory files that store the coordinates of the atoms throughout the simulation.
