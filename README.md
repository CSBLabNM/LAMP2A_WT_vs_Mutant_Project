# LAMP2A_WT_vs_Mutant_Project
# **Membrane Burial of Juxtamembrane Residues Weakens Oligomeric Interactions Leading to LAMP2A Inactivation**
# Overview
This repository contains molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data for both monomeric and homotrimeric assemblies of human Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein 2A (LAMP2A). The dataset includes simulations for the wild-type (WT) and an inactive mutant variant within a biologically relevant lysosomal membrane environment. The simulations were conducted for 1000 ns using GROMACS to investigate the structural and dynamic consequences of the mutation.
