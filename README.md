# Overview
This repository contains molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data for both monomeric and homotrimeric assemblies of human Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein 2A (LAMP2A). The dataset includes simulations for the wild-type (WT) and an inactive mutant variant within a biologically relevant lysosomal membrane environment. The simulations were conducted for 1000 ns using GROMACS to investigate the structural and dynamic consequences of the mutation.

Overview

This repository contains molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data for both monomeric and homotrimeric assemblies of human Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein 2A (LAMP-2A). The dataset includes simulations for the wild-type (WT) and an inactive mutant variant within a biologically relevant lysosomal membrane environment. The simulations were conducted for 1000 ns using GROMACS to investigate the structural and dynamic consequences of the mutation.
