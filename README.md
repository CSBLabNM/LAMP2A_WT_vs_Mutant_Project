# LAMP2A_WT_vs_Mutant_Project
# **Membrane Burial of Juxtamembrane Residues Weakens Oligomeric Interactions Leading to LAMP2A Inactivation**

This repository contains simulation files for both monomeric and homotrimeric assemblies of human LAMP-2A, including the wild-type (WT) and its inactive mutant, within a biologically relevant lysosomal membrane environment. The 1000ns simulations were performed using GROMACS.

**Repository Contents**
- **PDB Files:** Protein Data Bank files that contain the 3D structures of proteins and lipids used in the simulations.
- **XTC Files:** Compressed trajectory files that store the coordinates of the atoms throughout the simulation.
